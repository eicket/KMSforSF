# KMS for SF - Key Management System for WSJT-X Superfox

A proposal for authenticating a WSJT-X Superfox DX expedition. 

This proposal is referred to as the PB scheme, introduced in Aug 24, when different alternatives were examined to improve the authentication of a WSJT-X Superfox.

Version 3 of the PB scheme, comes with two design options :

- option 1, where 1024 keypairs are created, and any dx expedition can be attributed a free keypair 
- option 2, where keypairs are created on request and are attributed to a callsign, as dx expeditions come on air.

This repo implements option 2 (bootstrap with an empty keystore).

Signing and verifying the CQ message is done with the BN158 curve and BLS signature available from "The MIRACL Core Cryptographic Library" at https://github.com/miracl/core/tree/master
The order of this elliptic curve is 158 points and has a security level of about 80 bits.
Native implementations are available in C, C++, Go, Rust, Python, Java, Javascript and Swift programming languages, and the library is distributed with an Apache V2 license.
See https://github.com/miracl/core/blob/master/java/TestBLS.java for a working Java example with keypair generate, sign and verify.

The proposed superfox payload is as follows :

For a standard callsign we have 269 bits available for a signature :
c28 g15 s168 u101 v3 k10 q1 i3 = 329 bits 

For a non standard callsign we have 239 bits available for a signature :
c58 g15 s168 u71 v3 k10 q1 i3 = 329 bits

New for this encoding is :

s160 : the signature

u109 or u79 : unused bits

v3 : the version of the superfox payload (values could be : 0 : not authenticated, 1 : scheme 1, 2 : a better scheme, ...)

k10 : key index (1024 values)


The signature s168 is produced from the "<date_time>|<key Index>|<CQ message>" string, or similar. 
As an example : "240817_081230|5|CQ CY9C EM20" could result in a signature "0x02191cf5a121efa04c7976cd4213b0adfc4a556d8b"

The authentication at the hound is done in real time, without the need to do an online lookup.
The fox does not need an internet connection.
A further design decision can be made if the hound may or may not call the fox before he is heard.

## Sequence of events 

### 1. At the request of a DX expedition, the designated authority :

#### 1.1 creates a private key file with the requesting callsign, a new keypair, a free key index and the validity period

#### 1.2 optionally, encrypts the private key file with a strong password

#### 1.3 sends the encrypted file plus password to the DX expedition manager

#### 1.4 adds the .json entry to the private keystore. Example of a keystore.json with 3 DX expeditions :
```json
[ {
  "index" : 1,
  "callsign" : "N5J",
  "expedition" : "Palmyra and Jarvis Islands DX expedition",
  "startDate" : "2024-08-07",
  "endDate" : "2024-08-20",
  "privateKey" : "FfwDW32hREgACyceV5vXqfvrwbg=",
  "publicKey" : "AiKZwAUzudL7xNgBeBx3AIeWNAVSAcpyGl2yB/JgsidtV+cXjsOPLoY=",
  "password" : "4Hb4B9l2E"
}, {
  "index" : 2,
  "callsign" : "CY9C",
  "expedition" : "Saint Paul Island DX expedition",
  "startDate" : "2024-08-25",
  "endDate" : "2024-09-05",
  "privateKey" : "FaA/sYZjROJU43HgM5UxQ9Jc1VE=",
  "publicKey" : "AxBkb6kKvPgMImp1PdnbWIGTZqUuHb1lAQczlNm8Cws5lCqjhpt//Cg=",
  "password" : ""
}, {
  "index" : 1000,
  "callsign" : "KH8T",
  "expedition" : "American Samoa",
  "startDate" : "2024-08-30",
  "endDate" : "2024-09-16",
  "privateKey" : "D86QD9+WVhPfArUZHjlsw1td1YM=",
  "publicKey" : "AgFQzXgx9l5BRP3YSBhQzjJSKkwHHejw9aIlrIBGNsHq9Du5ngTs0Mk=",
  "password" : "edWw6F4IJ"
} ]
	
#### 1.5 appends a new .json entry to the public keystore. Example of a publicKeyFile.json with 3 DX expeditions :	
```json
[ {
  "index" : 1,
  "callsign" : "N5J",
  "expedition" : "Palmyra and Jarvis Islands DX expedition",
  "startDate" : "2024-08-07",
  "endDate" : "2024-08-20",
  "publicKey" : "AiKZwAUzudL7xNgBeBx3AIeWNAVSAcpyGl2yB/JgsidtV+cXjsOPLoY="
}, {
  "index" : 2,
  "callsign" : "CY9C",
  "expedition" : "Saint Paul Island DX expedition",
  "startDate" : "2024-08-25",
  "endDate" : "2024-09-05",
  "publicKey" : "AxBkb6kKvPgMImp1PdnbWIGTZqUuHb1lAQczlNm8Cws5lCqjhpt//Cg="
}, {
  "index" : 1000,
  "callsign" : "KH8T",
  "expedition" : "American Samoa",
  "startDate" : "2024-08-30",
  "endDate" : "2024-09-16",
  "publicKey" : "AgFQzXgx9l5BRP3YSBhQzjJSKkwHHejw9aIlrIBGNsHq9Du5ngTs0Mk="
} ]	

#### 1.6 uploads the updated public keystore to the wsjtx website.
		
### 2. At the fox side, the encrypted private key file is optionally decrypted with the strong password, and stored together with its contents.

### 3. When the fox comes on air, he beacons the authenticated CQ message, as per the superfox payload description, at a configurable interval.

See cpp/sign.cpp for implementation details.

### 4. RRR messages are not authenticated but the key index is included in the superfox payload, so that another genuine wsjtx fox / hound cannot interfere.

### 5. The hound downloads, at his convenience, the latest version of the public keystore. As from now on, CQ messages are authenticated in real time.

See cpp/verify.cpp

### 6. If a key revocation must be done before the <end_date>, the designated authority deletes the keypair from the private keystore, and re-publishes the public keystore.

## The KMS for the designated authority

![Alt text](KMS.png)
 

As for the WSJTX application, the sampling rate is 12000 Hz. 

NR_OF_SAMPLES_PER_SYMBOL_WSPR = 8192  
NR_OF_SAMPLES_PER_SYMBOL_FT4 = 576   
NR_OF_SAMPLES_PER_SYMBOL_FT8 = 1920  

The symbol duration is calculated as NR_OF_SAMPLES_PER_SYMBOL / 12000 and the tone separation is 1 / symbol duration.

So, for each mode we have :

| Mode | NR_OF_SAMPLES_PER_SYMBOL | symbol duration | tone separation  
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| WSPR | 8192 | 682,66 msec     | 1,465 Hz  |
| FT4 | 576 | 48 msec         | 20,833 Hz  |
| FT8 | 1920 | 160 msec        | 6,25 Hz  |
| Tone | 8192 => a 1 minute continuous sine wave  


## Gaussian smoothing (FT4/FT8)

As per the protocol definition, all modes use a continuous phase frequency shift keying.

FT4/FT8 frequency deviations are smoothed with a Gaussian filter. 
A single Gaussian smoothed frequency deviation pulse is created according to equation (3) in [1] and then superposed on each symbol. 
The length of the pulse is limited to a 3 symbol window and is superposed on the previous, current and next symbol.
The frequency deviation, calculated as a phase angle, is calculated per sample with a raised-cosine ramp applied to the first and last symbol.

The Gaussian-smoothed frequency deviation pulse has the following shape for FT4 (BT=1), FT8 (BT=2) and an almost rectangular frequency deviation (BT=99) :

The effect of the FT4 frequency deviation smoothing (BT=1) can be clearly observed, compared to a pure rectangular frequency deviation :

![Alt text](/screenshots/FT4_frequency_deviation.jpg)

The above diagram shows frequency deviations for symbols : 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3, 1, 3, 0

As for FT8, a milder smoothing is applied (BT=2) :

![Alt text](/screenshots/FT8_frequency_deviation.jpg)

The above diagram shows frequency deviations for symbols :  0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 0, 6 

## ft8code utility

For FT8, the source-encoded message, 14-bit CRC, parity bits and channel symbols can be verified with the excellent FT8code.exe tool, packaged with the WSJTX app :

C:\WSJT\wsjtx\bin>ft8code "FREE FRE FREE"

Some comments in the code, refer to the output of this utility for a free text message with contents "FREE FRE FREE"

## Java environment

This java application runs on all recent Java versions and was tested on Java 1.8, 15 and 17.
The app is developed with NetBeans 12.6 and the project properties can be found in the nbproject folder.

For all audio processing, the app uses the native javax library. So no external libraries, dll's .. are required.

The user interface is developed with JavaFX version 15. The GUI layout is defined in the Main.fxml file and can be edited by hand, or better, with the JavaFX SceneBuilder.

In your IDE, make sure that the following jar files are on the project classpath :  
javafx-swt.jar  
javafx.base.jar  
javafx.controls.jar  
javafx.fxml.jar  
javafx.graphics.jar  
javafx.media.jar  
javafx.swing.jar  
javafx.web.jar  
as well as charm-glisten-6.0.6.jar  

The Java app can be started up as follows :
java --module-path "{your path to Java FX}\openjfx-15.0.1_windows-x64_bin-sdk\javafx-sdk-15.0.1\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -Djava.util.logging.config.file=console_logging.properties -jar "dist\myWSJTEncoder.jar"

Two more Java apps are provided to display the Gaussian smoothed pulse and the Frequency deviation per mode.
